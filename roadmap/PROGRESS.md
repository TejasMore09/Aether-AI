# Progress log

Newest first. One entry per thing a person would call "done" — not per commit.

Keep entries honest about what was *not* finished. A log that only records
wins is a log that stops being read.

## 2026-08-28 — Roadmap folder created

Phase 0 assessed as complete; Phase 1 started.

The prompt for this was a blunt question — how far is this from the product I
described? — and the honest answer needed writing down rather than saying once
in a conversation that will be discarded.

**Assessed position:** roughly 70% of "a robust multi-tenant monitoring
platform", roughly 15% of the vision in `VISION.md`. The gap is the
distinctive half: no knowledge base, no sector awareness, no cross-domain
reasoning, no forecasting.

Verified rather than assumed — each of those returned nothing when searched
for. `pgvector` is in the Docker image and the extension has never been
created.

## 2026-08-28 — Repository cleaned, prototype removed

74 files, 12,919 lines: `api/`, `database/`, `adaptation/`, `features/`,
`frontend/`, `models/`, `scripts/`, `main.py`, `aether.db`, `mlflow.db`.

The repository had contained two systems — an MLOps prototype built around
drift detection and retraining, and the platform that replaced it — and anyone
opening the root found the wrong one first. PR #3 had been closed a week
earlier precisely because it was editing code nothing called.

Verified dead before removing: nothing under `platform/` imported any of it,
CI already only built `platform/**`, and `aether.db` only kept appearing as
modified because `database/db.py` opened it on import.

Also retired five secrets, since `api/services/` was the sole consumer of each.
`GEMINI_API_KEY` is now the only secret this project needs.

Also fixed: `.env.example` never mentioned the provider key, and getting it
wrong fails silently. See D15.

**Working copy moved** to `C:\dev\Aether-AI`, out of the Google Drive synced
folder. Drive had been syncing a live `.git` directory; `git gc` took the
repository from 748MB to 36MB, almost all unreachable loose objects.

## 2026-08-27 — Sales pipeline pack (domain three)

Two files, zero engine changes — the diff against `policy/`, `pack.py` and
`derive.py` was empty, and a test asserts that.

This was the domain that had to justify cash breaking the engine. It is also
the hardest case for a published band anywhere in the product: a referral firm
closing half its quotes and an outbound firm closing one in twenty are both
healthy, and judged against each other either looks broken.

**Not real:** the thresholds were tuned against invented scenarios until the
ladder looked sensible. That is not validation.

## 2026-08-27 — Cash & runway pack, and two engine gaps it exposed

Domain two, and the one that broke the engine twice — both genuine defects.

`shortfall_scaled` economics, because no owner reports the fraction of bills
they cannot pay. And `existential` metrics, because the payback test weighed
"payroll covered for 0.8 months" against $1,200 and recommended a review.

See D5 and D6.

## 2026-08-27 — Per-tenant calibrated bands

The pack already claimed a tenant's baseline superseded its defaults. That was
true for drift and false for health: every business was judged against one
fixed band, so a supplier on 60-day terms scored 0.67 on every reading it
would ever submit.

Anchored so a chronically unhealthy business cannot normalise its own
dysfunction. See D7.

Also fixed a contradiction it exposed — explanations quoted the pack's band
while the engine used the tenant's. See D14.

## 2026-08-27 — Main brain and staff console

Fleet control that does not cost tenants their privacy: an aggregate-only
database view, break-glass grants with written reasons mirrored into the
customer's own audit log, and an append-only staff trail enforced by a
trigger.

The break-glass gate was mutation-checked — stubbing it to always pass fails
five tests, so they are load-bearing rather than decorative.

Console built as a separate Next.js app, deliberately unlike the customer
product. See D9 through D12.

---

## 2026-08-26 — Ingest API keys and the Connections page

Per-tenant credentials so an unattended connector can push readings without
borrowing a human's session. SHA-256 rather than bcrypt, deliberately: these
are 256-bit CSPRNG tokens, so there is nothing to brute-force.

Verified by running the page's own printed curl verbatim, then confirming the
same key got 401 on the audit trail.

## Earlier — Phase 0 foundation

Multi-tenant platform with Postgres RLS, control plane, agent runtime, domain
pack format, cost-aware decision engine, quality gate with quarantine,
Temporal monitor loop, LLM diagnosis with fallback, receivables pack, customer
dashboard.

Detail lives in the commit history, which carries the reasoning.
